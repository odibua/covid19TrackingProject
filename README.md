#Tracking COVID-19 by Ethnicity
**"Never let a good crisis go to waste"**

The purpose of his repository is to enable the relatively collection of real-time data
regarding covid cases/deaths from different counties and states, stratified by race.
In it's most ideal form this repository will:

1. contain real-time data about covid cases/deaths by ethnicity
2. contain this daa for different states/counties

The repository of data contained above has the potential to motivate future health/pandemic 
policies, quantify disparities in health outcomes, and enable research into what factors
exacerbate/alleviate health disparities.
